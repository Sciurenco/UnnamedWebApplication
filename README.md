# UnnamedWebApplication

I created that application to get a new skills and experience, also a reason was that I can do it and I like it.

Also, I need to say that this application is intended to show my back end skills,
and it's a cause why I realized simple front end without css and javascript.

This application is a simple CRUD project based on architecture pattern MVC.

Also, very important, this application still in progress,
I will add a new functional and other things like validation

So if you want to see how my application works follow the link bellow

if this link isn't work. It means that I closed my local server,
in this case you can just ask me, and I'll send a new link for you.
